The dataset includes 3587 images.
Shuttlecock are annotated in YOLOv11 format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 320x320 (Fit within)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* Random exposure adjustment of between -30 and +30 percent
